# Game Progress Implementation Test Guide

## Depth 1 Implementation Verification

This document outlines how to test the newly implemented game progress logic.

### ✅ Backend Components Created:
1. **GameProgressService.kt** - Handles game progress logic
2. **ModeratorMessage.kt** - DTO for moderator messages
3. **CurrentTurnMessage.kt** - DTO for turn management
4. **GameProgressResponse.kt** - Response DTO for game progress
5. **GameController.kt** - Modified to integrate game progress service

### ✅ Frontend Components Created:
1. **ModeratorMessage.jsx** - Component to display moderator messages
2. **GameContext.jsx** - Updated with:
   - SET_MODERATOR_MESSAGE action type
   - moderatorMessage state field
   - WebSocket subscriptions for moderator and turn messages

### 🎯 Test Scenarios

#### Test 1: Game Start Flow
1. Create a game room with at least 3 players
2. Click "게임 시작" button
3. **Expected Results:**
   - Moderator message "게임이 시작됩니다!" appears
   - After 2 seconds, message "{FirstPlayer}님 발언하세요." appears
   - Current turn player is set to the first player
   - Messages auto-hide after 3 seconds

#### Test 2: WebSocket Message Flow
1. Monitor browser console for debug logs
2. **Expected Console Logs:**
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] Moderator message received: {content: "게임이 시작됩니다!", ...}
   [DEBUG_LOG] Turn change received: {currentSpeakerId: 123, ...}
   ```

#### Test 3: Player Order Randomization
1. Start multiple games
2. Verify that player order is randomized each time
3. Check that different players become the first speaker

### 🔧 WebSocket Topics
- **Moderator Messages:** `/topic/game/{gameNumber}/moderator`
- **Turn Changes:** `/topic/game/{gameNumber}/turn`
