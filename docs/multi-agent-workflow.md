- Typography and spacing analysis
- Mobile responsiveness assessment
- Interaction design patterns

### 4. Game Designer Agent
**Role**: Game Mechanics & Flow Analysis
**Focus Areas**:
- Game flow and pacing optimization
- Player engagement mechanics
- Social interaction features
- Game state visualization
- Feedback systems and notifications
- Onboarding and tutorial improvements

### 5. Prompt Engineer Agent
**Role**: AI Integration & Enhancement
**Focus Areas**:
- AI-driven feature opportunities
- Prompt optimization for game scenarios
- Natural language processing improvements
- Automated testing prompts
- Documentation generation
- Context-aware help systems

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Environment Setup & Initial Analysis (30 minutes)
**Coordinator Tasks**:
1. Verify both servers are running (frontend & backend)
2. Execute initial Playwright tests to capture baseline metrics
3. Generate application state snapshots
4. Create shared analysis workspace

**Agent Handoff**: Initial findings document shared with all agents

### Phase 2: Concurrent Deep Analysis (60 minutes)
**All agents work simultaneously on their domains**:

**Frontend Developer**: 
- Run performance audits (Lighthouse, bundle analysis)
- Execute test suites and generate coverage reports
- Analyze component architecture and dependencies
- Identify technical debt and refactoring opportunities

**UI/UX Designer**:
- Conduct heuristic evaluation of all user journeys
- Analyze visual consistency across components
- Test responsive behavior on multiple viewports
- Document accessibility violations and improvements

**Game Designer**:
- Map complete game flow and identify friction points
- Analyze player engagement patterns
- Test social features and communication systems
- Evaluate game balance and progression mechanics

**Prompt Engineer**:
- Identify opportunities for AI enhancement
- Analyze existing prompts and documentation quality
- Design context-aware assistance systems
- Create automated testing scenarios

### Phase 3: Cross-Agent Validation & Integration (30 minutes)
**Coordinator orchestrates**:
- Agent findings review and validation
- Identify overlapping recommendations for consolidation
- Prioritize improvements by impact and feasibility
- Ensure 20 design + 20 UX improvements are distinct and comprehensive

### Phase 4: Deliverable Generation (45 minutes)
**Structured output creation in `docs/upgrade_1/`**:
- Individual agent reports
- Consolidated master improvement document
- Implementation roadmap with priorities
- Testing strategy for proposed changes

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Improvement Categories Validation
**Design Improvements (20 items)**:
- Visual consistency and branding
- Component design patterns
- Layout and spacing optimization
- Color and typography enhancements
- Icon and imagery improvements

**UX Improvements (20 items)**:
- User flow optimization
- Interaction design enhancements
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile experience optimization
- Error handling and feedback systems

### Non-Overlapping Validation
- Each improvement must have distinct scope and impact
- Cross-reference all recommendations to eliminate duplicates
- Ensure improvements complement rather than conflict
- Validate feasibility and implementation complexity

## Communication Protocols

### Agent Handoff Format
```markdown
## Agent: [Name]
## Phase: [Current Phase]
## Status: [Complete/In-Progress/Blocked]
## Key Findings: [3-5 bullet points]
## Handoff Items: [Specific deliverables for next agent]
## Dependencies: [Any blockers or requirements]
```

### Status Tracking
- Real-time progress updates via shared workspace
- Milestone checkpoints at end of each phase
- Issue escalation path for blockers
- Quality gates before deliverable finalization

## Success Criteria

### Completeness Metrics
- [ ] 40 total improvements identified (20 design + 20 UX)
- [ ] All improvements backed by data/analysis
- [ ] Zero overlap between improvement categories
- [ ] Implementation complexity assessed for each item
- [ ] Priority ranking with business impact justification

### Quality Standards
- [ ] All recommendations actionable and specific
- [ ] Technical feasibility validated
- [ ] User impact quantified where possible
