# Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
After creating a game room, the user remains in the lobby instead of entering the created game room.

## Root Cause
The `gameInitializationService.createGameRoom()` was initializing the game before navigation completed, causing timing issues.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Modified `gameInitializationService.ts`
- **createGameRoom()**: Removed the `initializeGameFromBackend()` call to prevent double initialization
- **joinGameRoom()**: Removed the `initializeGameFromBackend()` call to prevent double initialization
- Added console logs for debugging

### 2. Modified `GameRoomsSection.tsx`
- Added console logs to track game creation and navigation
- Navigation to `/game/${gameNumber}` now happens after game creation

### 3. GamePageV2.tsx (needs update)
- Should use `gameInitializationService.initializeGameFromBackend()` when component mounts
- This ensures proper initialization when navigating to the game page

## Expected Flow
1. User creates game room → Backend returns game number
2. Frontend navigates to `/game/${gameNumber}`
3. GamePageV2 component mounts and initializes the game
4. Game state is loaded and user enters the game room

## Testing Steps
1. Login to the application
2. Go to lobby
3. Click "새 게임방 만들기" (Create new game room)
4. Fill in game details
5. Click "생성" (Create)
6. Check browser console for:
   - "Game room created successfully with number: X"
   - "Game created successfully, gameNumber: X"
   - "Navigating to game page: /game/X"
7. Verify that the browser URL changes to `/game/X`
8. Verify that the game page loads successfully
