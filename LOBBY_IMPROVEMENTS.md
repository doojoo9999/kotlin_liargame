# Lobby Page Improvements & Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Timeout/Redirect Behavior
**Problem**: Modal windows were closing automatically after being open for a certain time and redirecting to lobby page.

**Solution**:
- Modified auto-refresh intervals to only run when document has focus (`document.hasFocus()`)
- This prevents background refreshes from interfering with user interactions in open modals
- Updated both lobby page components to use focus-aware refresh logic

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/versions/main/pages/LobbyPage.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/lobby/LobbyPage.tsx`

### 2. Default Target Score
**Problem**: Default target score was set to 100 points, not the desired 10 points.

**Solution**:
- Changed default `targetPoints` from 100 to 10 in GameRoomsSection
- Updated target points dropdown to include 10 as the first/default option
- Added explanation text about scoring system (liars get +2 points when they guess correctly)

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/components/lobby/GameRoomsSection.tsx`

### 3. Topic Selection Logic
**Problem**: Used complex random topic selection with count, instead of showing all topics as selected by default.

**Solution**:
- Changed default behavior to select all available topics when component loads
- Removed random topic selection mode entirely for simplicity
- Users can now uncheck topics they don't want (simpler UX)
- Updated UI to show "All topics selected by default" message
- Simplified subject validation and selection logic

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/components/lobby/GameRoomsSection.tsx`

### 4. Max Players Selection UI
**Problem**: Used dropdown for max players selection instead of a more visual gauge/slider.

**Solution**:
- Replaced Select dropdown with HTML5 range input (slider)
- Added visual indicators showing current value
- Used Tailwind's `accent-blue-600` for consistent styling
- Added labels at 3, 9, and 15 player marks for reference

**Files Changed**:
- `frontend/src/components/lobby/GameRoomsSection.tsx`

## Current Scoring Logic Documentation

Based on the codebase analysis, the current scoring system is:

### Simple Scoring (Target: 10 points)
- **Liar guesses topic correctly**: +2 points
- **Target**: Reach 10 points to win
- **Game continues until**: Liar reaches target or gets eliminated

### Complex Scoring (from scoreCalculations.ts)
The codebase also has a more complex scoring system available:
- **Liar eliminated correctly**: Correct voters +3 points
- **Innocent eliminated**: Liars +4 points, incorrect voters -1 point, correct voters +1 point
- **Liar survives final vote**: Liar +6 points
- **Liar guesses topic**: Liar +3 points

## UI/UX Improvements Summary

1. **Better Modal Stability**: No more unexpected modal closures due to background refreshes
2. **Clearer Target Scoring**: Default 10 points with explanation of 2-point system
3. **Simplified Topic Selection**: All topics selected by default, uncheck unwanted ones
4. **Visual Player Count**: Slider instead of dropdown for better user experience
5. **Improved Validation**: Better error messages for topic and room validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Modal Stability**: Open create game modal and leave it open for >30 seconds to verify it doesn't close
2. **Default Values**: Create new game and verify default target score is 10
3. **Topic Selection**: Verify all topics are selected by default when opening create game modal
4. **Slider Functionality**: Test player count slider across full range (3-15 players)
5. **Form Reset**: Create game and verify form resets with correct defaults after creation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Slider Styling**: Could add custom CSS for more sophisticated slider appearance
2. **Topic Categories**: Group topics by categories for better organization
3. **Save Preferences**: Remember user's preferred game settings
4. **Quick Create**: Add preset buttons for common game configurations
5. **Room Templates**: Allow saving and reusing room configurations
