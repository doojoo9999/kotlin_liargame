- **Features**:
  - Individual player updates via `updatePlayer()`
  - Player removal via `removePlayer()`
  - Full list replacement via `updateAllPlayers()`
  - Status filtering utilities (`getPlayersByStatus`, `getPlayerCountByStatus`)

### 4. useAdminMonitorWs.js
- **Purpose**: WebSocket connection and message handling
- **Features**:
  - Handles 4 message types: STATS_UPDATE, GAME_ROOM_UPDATE, PLAYER_UPDATE, ROOM_TERMINATED
  - Automatic reconnection on errors (5s delay)
  - Proper cleanup on unmount
  - Connection state and error management

### 5. useAutoRefresh.js
- **Purpose**: 30-second periodic refresh with proper cleanup
- **Features**:
  - Configurable refresh interval (default 30s)
  - Enable/disable functionality
  - Multiple refresh functions support
  - Promise.allSettled for error resilience
  - Proper cleanup on unmount

## 🎨 Presentation Components

### 1. StatsCards.jsx
- **Purpose**: Displays 4 statistics cards
- **Optimizations**: React.memo on both main component and StatCard
- **Features**: Configuration-driven card generation

### 2. GameRoomsTable.jsx & GameRoomRow.jsx
- **Purpose**: Real-time game rooms table with individual rows
- **Optimizations**: React.memo on row components for list performance
- **Features**: Empty state handling, status chips, password indicators

### 3. PlayersList.jsx & PlayerItem.jsx
- **Purpose**: Connected players list with individual items
- **Optimizations**: React.memo on item components, scrollable container
- **Features**: Avatar generation, status display, empty state handling

### 4. ConnectionStatus.jsx
- **Purpose**: WebSocket connection status display
- **Features**: Visual indicators for connected/connecting/error states

## 🚀 React-Query v5 Best Practices Applied

### Query Configuration
- **staleTime**: 30 seconds (data considered fresh)
- **gcTime**: 5 minutes (cache garbage collection)
- **refetchOnWindowFocus**: false (prevent unnecessary refetches)
- **refetchOnReconnect**: true (refetch when connection restored)
- **retry**: 2 attempts on failure

### Query Key Namespacing
- `['admin', 'stats']` for admin statistics
- `['game', 'rooms']` for game rooms
- `['admin', 'players']` for player data

### Real-time Updates Strategy
- Use `setQueryData` for real-time WebSocket updates instead of manual refetch
- Selective invalidation only when necessary (e.g., room termination → stats invalidation)

## 🔌 WebSocket Integration Improvements

### Message Type Handling
1. **STATS_UPDATE**: Direct cache update via `setQueryData`
2. **GAME_ROOM_UPDATE**: Individual room updates with fallback to full refresh
3. **PLAYER_UPDATE**: Support for both single player and full list updates
4. **ROOM_TERMINATED**: Room removal + stats invalidation

### Connection Management
- Automatic reconnection on failure
- Proper subscription/unsubscription lifecycle
- Error state management with user feedback

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Component Memoization
- All presentation components wrapped with `React.memo`
- Stable keys for list items (`room.gameNumber`, `player.id`)
- Callback stabilization with `useCallback`

### Efficient Re-rendering
- Separated data hooks prevent unnecessary component re-renders
- Memoized derived calculations with `useMemo`
- Minimized inline object creation

### List Performance
- Individual row/item components are memoized
- Proper key props for React reconciliation
- Virtualization-ready structure (can add react-window if needed)

## 🔧 Side Effect Management

### Cleanup Guarantees
- WebSocket disconnection on unmount
- Timer/interval cleanup (auto-refresh)
- Proper effect dependency arrays

### Error Boundaries
- WebSocket error handling with user feedback
- React-query error states properly managed
- Fallback mechanisms for failed operations

## 📊 Benefits Achieved
