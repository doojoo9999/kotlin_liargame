# Authentication System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Import Path Inconsistency
**Problem**: `useSessionManager.ts` was importing from the wrong path (`../store/authStore` instead of `../stores/authStore`)
**Fix**: Updated import path to use the correct stores directory

### 2. Session Refresh Loop Prevention
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent session refresh requests causing infinite loops and 400 errors
**Fix**: 
- Added `isRefreshing` flag to prevent concurrent refresh attempts
- Implemented promise-based refresh queue to handle multiple requests
- Added failure count tracking with maximum retry limits

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem**: Poor error handling leading to unhandled exceptions and inconsistent state
**Fix**:
- Updated `AuthService.refreshSession()` to return structured responses instead of throwing
- Added graceful error handling throughout the auth flow
- Implemented proper cleanup on session expiration

### 4. API Client Session Management
**Problem**: No automatic session refresh on 401/403 responses
**Fix**:
- Added automatic session refresh retry mechanism in API client
- Implemented session state cleanup on authentication failures
- Added custom event dispatch for session expiration notifications

### 5. Race Condition Prevention
**Problem**: Multiple simultaneous auth checks causing state inconsistencies
**Fix**:
- Added concurrent request protection in auth store
- Implemented proper state synchronization
- Added refresh promise sharing to prevent duplicate requests

### 6. Session Manager Improvements
**Problem**: Aggressive session refresh causing server load and errors
**Fix**:
- Added failure count tracking with maximum retry limits (3 attempts)
- Improved activity-based session refresh logic
- Added proper cleanup and timeout handling

## Key Changes Made

### File: `/src/api/client.ts`
- Added session refresh mechanism with retry logic
- Implemented automatic auth failure handling (401/403)
- Added promise-based refresh queue to prevent concurrent requests
- Enhanced error handling with proper type definitions

### File: `/src/services/authService.ts`
- Changed `refreshSession()` to return structured responses instead of throwing
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added graceful failure handling

### File: `/src/stores/authStore.ts`
- Added concurrent request protection with `isRefreshing` flag
- Implemented session expiration event listener
- Enhanced state management and cleanup
- Added proper TypeScript typing

### File: `/src/hooks/useSessionManager.ts`
- Fixed import path for auth store
- Added maximum retry limit (3 failures) before logout
- Implemented activity-based session timeout (30 minutes)
- Added proper failure tracking and recovery

### File: `/src/types/auth.ts`
- Added `isRefreshing` flag to AuthState interface

### File: `/src/App.tsx`
- Improved initialization flow to avoid localStorage race conditions
- Better WebSocket connection timing based on auth state

### File: `/src/utils/authHelpers.ts` (New)
- Added utility functions for session validation
- Implemented safe localStorage operations
- Added retry mechanism and debounce utilities

## Configuration Constants

```typescript
// Session refresh interval: 15 minutes
const SESSION_REFRESH_INTERVAL = 15 * 60 * 1000;

// Maximum consecutive failures before logout: 3
const MAX_REFRESH_FAILURES = 3;

// Activity timeout: 30 minutes
const ACTIVITY_BASED_SESSION_TIMEOUT = 30 * 60 * 1000;
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **No more infinite refresh loops**: Session refresh attempts are limited and queued
2. **Graceful error handling**: Failed refreshes don't crash the application
3. **Proper cleanup**: Authentication state is consistently cleaned up on failures
4. **Activity-based refresh**: Sessions only refresh when user is active
5. **Retry limits**: Maximum 3 consecutive failures before forcing logout
6. **Type safety**: All TypeScript types are properly defined

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test session expiration**: Manually expire session and verify graceful handling
2. **Test network interruptions**: Verify behavior during connectivity issues
3. **Test concurrent requests**: Ensure multiple API calls don't cause refresh loops
4. **Test activity detection**: Verify inactive users don't trigger unnecessary refreshes
5. **Test failure recovery**: Verify system recovers after temporary backend issues

## Monitoring

The system now includes comprehensive logging for:
- Session refresh attempts and results
- Authentication state changes
- Error conditions and recovery actions
- Activity detection and timeout handling

Monitor these logs to ensure the authentication system is working correctly in production.
